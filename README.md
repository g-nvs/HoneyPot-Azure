# Azure Sentinel HoneyPot Lab

## Objective

The Azure Sentinel Lab objectives are aimed to gain practical hands-on with Azure environment and Services, like Sentinel or Log Analytics, as well as understanding the benefits of Honeypots for cybersecurity defenses.
A honeypot serves as an intentionally vulnerable system designed to attract potential attackers, thereby enabling the collection of valuable information to analyze and mitigate cyber threats.

### Skills Learned

- Demonstrate proficiency in deploying T-Pot, an open-source honeypot solution, on Azure to enhance security measures.
- Utilize Azure services to set up Windows & Linux instances and configure network settings to support T-Pot installation and operation.
- Showcase expertise in Linux operating systems, cloud technologies, network security principles, and access control configurations in Azure.
- Monitor and analysis of honeypot data to gain insights into attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through Kinana.
- Logstash integration with Azure Sentinel to provide TPot insights on various Threats and Attacks and create Dashboards, and query data.
- Sysmon integration with Azure Sentinel for additional log details on Windows endpoint.

### Tools Used

- Azure Services: Sentinel, Log Analytics Workspace, Workbooks, Network Security Groups, Data Collection Rules/Data Collection Endpoint
- Powershell
- Logstash
- Kibana
- 3rd Party Geolocation API (https://ipgeolocation.io/)
