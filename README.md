# Azure HoneyPot Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts, practical application and Wazuh architecture.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Tuning up of IDS and Agents default Rules to narrow down false positives.
- Understanding and creation of Custom Rules in Wazuh, for specific log ingestion in the System.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh for log centralization, ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Sysmon for detailed information about process creations, network connections and real time changes to filesystem in Windows endpoints.
- Suricata configured as an IDS, for real-time threat detection and threat hunting.
- Zeek for a comprehensive view and analysis of the network activity. It allows to supplement Suricata logs.
